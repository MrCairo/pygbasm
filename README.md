# pygbasm
GameBoy assembler/linker in Python

This is an experimental project that will compile LR35902 (Z80-ish) assembly and create an executable that is compatible with a Game Boy (DMG) ROM that can, in turn, be run by on-line emulators such as https://gameplaycolor.com.

This compiler is designed so that hobbyists can create/test/play their own DMG and Game Boy Color games. 

One of the goals of this project is to be able to build and run a game from an iPad using [Pythonista](http://omz-software.com/pythonista/) 

At this point, this code is very incomplete and not even usable. It also represents my first Python project. Proceed with caution.
